 A type of cellular automata called cyclic space was discovered by David Griffeath of the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1990. Cyclic Space is described in  [The Magic Machine A Handbook of Computer Sorcery](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Machine-Handbook-Computer-Sorcery/dp/0716721252/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2N7PKFJOVUI49&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NTLdsrNDLEk1x3LeOBQyww.nWfU52fpvLMdRJsWOJv1BBOrNoiGSeZ0rMMVjCoi1Ns&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+magic+machine+a.k.+dewdney&qid=1729741595&sprefix=the+magic+machine+a.k.+dewdnet%2Caps%2C169&sr=8-1) by A.K.

 This page is a cyclic space simulator I wrote to explore these automata and a mimi project to brush up on my Python coding and to try out [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) . 
 Cyclic Space is a grid of cells where each cell has one of n possible values, numbered 0 through n-1. Cyclic spaces are most interesting when n is fairly small. In each generation any cell with a value k will eat any neighboring cell that has value k-1. Cells is the 0 state will eat cells in the n-1 state thus allowing loops of state changes.  Choose any image to load. You can then choose the number of colors to color-reduce the image into an image with n colors. The cyclic algorithm will then run successive generations of the cyclic space. You can also scale the image. Smaller images animate faster. Watch for the "Demons" of cyclic space to appear. These crystal seeds will continue to grow.
